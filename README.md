# data-structures-and-algorithms for code 401
Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout Code Fellows 401 Python course, I will complete a set of daily code challenges.

[1. Reverse an Array](dsa/challenges/array_reverse/README.md)

[2. Insert and shift an array in middle at index](dsa/challenges/array_shift/README.md)

[3. Binary search in a sorted 1D array](dsa/challenges/array_binary_search/readme.md)
